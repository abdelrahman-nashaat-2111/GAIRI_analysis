**01_Data_Sources:**

This folder contains the two primary source datasets that form the foundation of the GAIRI Analysis. These are the raw, original data files from which all subsequent data processing and analysis were derived. **The database consists of:**

The GAIRI Analysis Project delves into the evolving landscape of Government AI Readiness, specifically comparing the progress and key trends observed in 2023 and 2024. This analysis is crucial, as governments globally are increasingly recognizing AI's transformative potential for public services, economic growth, and societal well-being.

Government AI Readiness typically assesses a country's capacity to integrate and leverage AI technologies across various dimensions. Leading reports, such as those by Oxford Insights, often evaluate readiness across three core pillars:

**1. Government Pillar:** This assesses the strategic vision, governance frameworks (including AI ethics principles and regulations), leadership, and policies in place to facilitate responsible AI adoption within the public sector.

**2. Technology Sector Pillar:** This focuses on the strength and maturity of a country's technology industry, including innovation capacity, human capital (availability of AI talent), and the overall AI ecosystem.
   
**3. Data & Infrastructure Pillar:** This evaluates a country's capability to support AI development and implementation through its technological and data ecosystems, encompassing digital infrastructure, data availability, quality, and robust data governance.

Key trends observed between 2023 and 2024 generally indicate a growing momentum in government AI readiness worldwide. While high-income countries often lead, there's a noticeable trend of middle and low-income economies closing the gap, primarily by strengthening foundational governance and data-related areas. More countries are publishing or announcing national AI strategies, highlighting a formalization of their AI visions. There is also an increased emphasis on ethical AI principles, data privacy, and international cooperation to address the challenges and risks associated with AI adoption.

**02_Modified_Database:**

The **"Modified Database"** in this project is a meticulously prepared dataset that represents a combination of the raw Government AI Readiness data from both 2023 and 2024. This combined dataset has undergone a rigorous process of summarization and consolidation. This summarization involves:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Gain a deep understanding of the data's source, meaning, collection methods, and context. Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify initial quality issues (e.g., count missing values, check data distributions, identify unique values).

2. **Aggregating key indicators:** Instead of raw, granular data points for each country and dimension, the database may contain aggregated scores, year-over-year changes, or calculated readiness levels.
   
3. **Synthesizing insights:** The data has been processed to highlight the most pertinent information, such as average readiness scores across regions, top movers and shakers in the rankings, and significant improvements or areas of concern within specific pillars (Government, Technology, Data & Infrastructure).
   
4. **Focusing on comparative analysis:** The summarization enables a direct comparison of AI readiness evolution, making it easier to discern trends, identify best practices, and pinpoint areas where governments are making notable progress or facing persistent challenges in their AI journey from 2023 to 2024.
   
This modified database serves as the foundation for the GAIRI Analysis Dashboard, allowing for an efficient and impactful visualization of the nuanced shifts and overall trajectory of government AI readiness.

**03_Dashboard_Icons:**

This folder contains a curated collection of icons specifically designed and optimized for integration into the GAIRI Analysis Power BI Dashboard. These icons contribute to a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, enhancing data comprehension and navigation.

**04_GAIRI_Analysis_Dashboard**:

This folder contains the final Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) for the GAIRI Analysis Dashboard. This dashboard provides comprehensive insights derived from the analyzed data, featuring interactive visualizations and key performance indicators relevant to the GAIRI analysis objectives.
